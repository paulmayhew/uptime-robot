# Uptime Robot

Uptime Robot is a straightforward uptime monitoring service that regularly checks your website and alerts you if it goes offline. It's an excellent tool for ensuring your website stays operational.

I created this project out of frustration with the downtime of the original [Uptime&nbsp;Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/) service. My goal was to develop a simple monitoring solution that I could host on my own AWS server, giving me full control. The project is designed for easy setup and configuration, allowing you to customize it to suit your specific requirements.

## Features

- **Simple**: Uptime Robot is designed to be simple and easy to use. Just add your website URL and email address, and you're good to go. It can automatically load the URLs from a file and monitor them after you modify the file.

- **Customizable**: You can customize the monitoring interval, timeout, and notification settings to suit your needs.

- **Self-hosted**: Uptime Robot is a self-hosted solution, so you have full control over your data and can run it on your own server.

- **Open-source**: Uptime Robot is open-source and free to use. You can view the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/J16N/uptime-robot).

## Getting Started

To get started with Uptime Robot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/J16N/uptime-robot.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd uptime-robot
    poetry shell
    poetry install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file and add your configuration. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

    ```bash
    cp .env .env
    ```

4. Run the application. It will generate `monitor.txt` file. Add the links you want to monitor in this file. Each link should be on a new line.

    ```bash
